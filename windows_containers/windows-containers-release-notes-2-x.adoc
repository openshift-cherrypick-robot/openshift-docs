== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is a feature providing the ability to run Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

[id="getting-support"]
== Getting support

You must have a subscription to receive support for the Red Hat WMCO. Deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported without a subscription. If you do not have a subscription, you can use the community WMCO, a distribution that lacks official support. Request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 2.0.3

Issued: 2021-07-28

The WMCO 2.0.3 is now available with bug fixes. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:2926[RHBA-2021:2926].

[id="wmco-2-0-3-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* This WMCO release fixes a bug that prevented users from upgrading to WMCO 3.0.0. Users should upgrade to WMCO 2.0.3 before upgrading to {product-title} 4.8, which only supports WMCO 3.0.0. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985349[**BZ#1985349**])

[id="wmco-2-0-2"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 2.0.2

Issued: 2021-07-08

The WMCO 2.0.2 is now available with bug fixes. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:2671[RHBA-2021:2671].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users who are running a version of WMCO prior to 2.0.3 should first upgrade to WMCO 2.0.3 prior to upgrading to WMCO 3.0.0. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1983153[**BZ#1983153**])

=== Bug fixes
* {product-title} 4.8 enables the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` option by default. This option attaches the projected volumes to all of the pods. In addition, {product-title} 4.8 adds xref:../rest_api/objects/index.adoc#podsecuritycontext-core-v1[the `RunAsUser` option to the `SecurityContext`]. This combination results in Windows pods being stuck in the `ContainerCreating` status. To work around this issue, you should upgrade to WMCO 2.0.2 before upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 4.8. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975553[**BZ#1975553**])

[id="wmco-2-0-1"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 2.0.1

Issued: 2021-06-23

The WMCO 2.0.1 is now available with bug fixes. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2130[RHSA-2021:2130].

[id="wmco-2-0-1-improvements"]
=== New features and improvements

This release adds the following new features and improvements.

[id="wmco-2-0-1-image-timeout"]
==== Increased image pull time-out duration

Image pull time-out has been increased to 30 minutes.

[id="wmco-2-0-1-autoscaling-windows-instances"]
==== Autoscaling for Windows instances

Cluster autoscaling is now supported for Windows instances. You can complete the following actions for Windows nodes:

* Define and deploy a xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#configuring-clusterautoscaler[cluster autoscaler].
* Create a Windows node using a xref:../windows_containers/creating_windows_machinesets/creating-windows-machineset-vsphere.adoc#creating-windows-machineset-vsphere[Windows machine set].
* Define and deploy a xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#configuring-machineautoscaler[machine autoscaler], referencing a Windows machine set.

[id="wmco-2-0-1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, when using the Windows kube-proxy component on an AWS installation, when you created a LoadBalancer service, packets would be misrouted and reached an unintended destination. Now, packets are no longer wrongly routed to unintended destinations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1946538[**BZ#1946538**])

* Previously, Windows nodes were not reporting some key node-level metrics via telemetry monitoring. The `windows_exporter` reports various metrics as `windows_*` instead of the `node_exporter` equivalent of `node_*`. Now, the telemetry results cover all of the expected metrics. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955319[**BZ#1955319**])

* Previously, when the WMCO configured Windows instances, if the hybrid-overlay or kube-proxy components failed, the node might report itself as `Ready`. Now, the error is detected and the node reports itself as `NotReady`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956412[**BZ#1956412**])

* Previously, the kube-proxy service would terminate unexpectedly after the load balancer is created if you created the load balancer after the Windows pods begin running. Now, the kube-proxy service does not crash when recreating the load balancer service. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939968[**BZ#1939968**])

=== RHSA-2021:2130 - Windows Container support for {product-title} security update

As part of the previously noted bug fix (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1946538[**BZ#1946538**]), an update for Windows kube-proxy is now available for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 2.0.1. Details of the update are documented in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2130[RHSA-2021:2130] advisory.

[id="wmco-2-0-0"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 2.0.0

This release of the WMCO provides bug fixes and enhancements for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO 2.0.0 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:0440[RHBA-2021:0440].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running Windows container workloads is not supported for clusters in a restricted network or disconnected environment.
====

Version 2.x of the WMCO is only compatible with {product-title} 4.7.

[id="wmco-2-0-0-improvements"]
=== New features and improvements

This release adds the following new features and improvements.

[id="wmco-2-0-0-vsphere-support"]
==== Support for clusters running on VMware vSphere

You can now run Windows nodes on a cluster installed on VMware vSphere version 6.5, 6.7, or 7.0. You can create a Windows `MachineSet` object on vSphere to host Windows Server compute nodes. For more information, see xref:../windows_containers/creating_windows_machinesets/creating-windows-machineset-vsphere.adoc#creating-windows-machineset-vsphere[Creating a Windows `MachineSet` object on vSphere].

[id="wmco-2-0-0-monitoring"]
==== Enhanced Windows node monitoring

Windows nodes are now fully integrated with most of the monitoring capabilities provided by the web console. However, it is not possible to view workload graphs for pods running on Windows nodes in this release.

[id="wmco-2-0-0-known-issues"]
== Known issues

* When you create Windows pods with `RunAsUserName` set in its "SecurityContext" with a projected volume associated with these pods, the file ownership permissions for the projected entities are ignored, resulting in incorrectly configured ownership permissions.

* The filesystem graphs available in the web console do not display for Windows nodes. This is caused by changes in the filesystem queries. This will be fixed in a future release of WMCO. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1930347[*BZ#1930347*])

* The Prometheus windows_exporter used by the WMCO currently collects metrics through HTTP, so it is considered unsafe. You must ensure that only trusted users can retrieve metrics from the endpoint. The windows_exporter feature recently added support for HTTPS configuration, but this configuration has not been implemented for WMCO. Support for HTTPS configuration in the WMCO will be added in a future release.
