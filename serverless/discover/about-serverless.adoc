You can propagate an event from an xref:../../serverless/discover/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to multiple event sinks by using:

* xref:../../serverless/discover/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[Channels and subscriptions], or
* xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[Brokers] and xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-triggers.adoc#serverless-triggers[Triggers].
