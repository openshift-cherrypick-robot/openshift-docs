Security vulnerabilities in your environment might be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as denial of service, remote code execution, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Therefore, the management of vulnerabilities is a foundational step towards a successful Kubernetes security program.

== Viewing vulnerabilities

{product-title-short} provides the following methods to view vulnerabilities discovered in your system:

* To view application vulnerabilities by namespace or deployment, or to view vulnerabilities in an image, in the {product-title-short} web portal, go to *Vulnerability Management (1.0)* -> *Dashboard*.
* To view vulnerabilities in applications running on clusters in your system, go to *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Workload CVEs*. You can filter vulnerabilities by image, deployment, namespace, and cluster.

== Vulnerability reporting

You can create and download an on-demand image vulnerability report from the *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* menu in the {product-title-short} web portal. This report includes a comprehensive list of common vulnerabilities and exposures across images and deployments, called workload CVEs in {product-title-short}. You can share this report with auditors or internal stakeholders by scheduling emails in {product-title-short} or by downloading the report and sharing it by using other methods.
