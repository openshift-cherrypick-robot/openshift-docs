The recommended resource guidelines were developed by performing a focused test that created the following objects across a given number of namespaces:

* 10 deployments, with 3 pod replicas in a sleep state, mounting 4 secrets, 4 config maps
* 10 services, each one pointing to the TCP/8080 and TCP/8443 ports of one of the previous deployments
* 1 route pointing to the first of the previous services
* 10 secrets containing 2048 random string characters
* 10 config maps containing 2048 random string characters

During the analysis of results, the number of deployments is identified as a primary factor for increasing of used resources. And we are using the number of deployments for the estimation of required resources.
