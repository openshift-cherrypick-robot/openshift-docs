[role="_abstract"]
When you install {product-title}, it creates:

* A namespace called `rhacs-operator` where the Operator is installed, if you chose the Operator method of installation
* A namespace called `stackrox`, or another namespace where you created the Central and SecuredCluster custom resources
* `PodSecurityPolicy` and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) objects for all components
* Additional labels on namespaces, for use in generated network policies
//TODO: Add link to generate network policies
* An application custom resource definition (CRD), if it does not exist

Uninstalling {product-title} involves deleting all of these items.
