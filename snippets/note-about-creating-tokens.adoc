[NOTE]
====
* To prevent privilege escalation, when you create a new token, your role's permissions limit the permission you can assign to that token. For example, if you only have `read` permission for the Integration resource, you cannot create a token with `write` permission.
* If you want a custom role to create tokens for other users to use, you must assign the required permissions to that custom role.
* Use short-lived tokens for machine-to-machine communication, such as CI/CD pipelines, scripts, and other automation. Also, use the `roxctl central login` command for human-to-machine communication, such as `roxctl` CLI or API access.
