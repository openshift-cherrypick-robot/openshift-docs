= Troubleshooting your dynamic plug-in

Refer to this list of troubleshooting tips if you run into issues loading your plug-in.

* Verify that you have enabled your plug-in in the console Operator configuration and your plug-in name is the output by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get console.operator.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.plugins}'
----

** Verify the enabled plug-ins on the status card of the *Overview* page in the *Administrator perspective*. You will need to refresh your browser if the plug-in was recently enabled.

* Verify your plug-in service is healthy by:
** Verifying your plug-in pod status is running and your containers are ready.
** Verifying the service label selector matches the pod and the target port is correct.
** Curl the `plugin-manifest.json` from the service in a terminal on the console pod or another pod on the cluster.

* Verify your `ConsolePlugin` resource name (`consolePlugin.name`) matches the plug-in name used in `package.json`.

* Verify your service name, namespace, port, and path are declared correctly in the `ConsolePlugin` resource.

* Verify your plug-in service uses HTTPS and service serving certificates.

* Verify any certificates or connection errors in the console pod logs.

* Verify the feature flag your plug-in relys on is not disabled.

* Verify your plug-in does not have any `consolePlugin.dependencies` in `package.json` that are not met.
** This can include console version dependencies or dependencies on other plug-ins. Filter the JS console in your browser for your plug-in's name to see messages that are logged.

* Verify there are no typos in the nav extension perspective or section IDs.
** Your plug-in may be loaded, but nav items missing if IDs are incorrect. Try navigating to a plug-in page directly by editing the URL.

* Verify there are no network policies that are blocking traffic from the console pod to your plug-in service.
** If necessary, adjust network policies to allow console pods in the openshift-console namespace to make requests to your service.

* Verify the list of dynamic plug-ins to be loaded in your browser in the *Console* tab of the developer tools browser.
** Evaluate `window.SERVER_FLAGS.consolePlugins` to see the dynamic plug-in on the Console frontend.
