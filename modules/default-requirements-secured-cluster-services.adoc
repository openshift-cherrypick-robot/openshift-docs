[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services_{context}"]
= Secured cluster services

Secured cluster services contain the following components:

* Sensor
* Admission controller
* Collector

[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services-sensor_{context}"]
== Sensor

Sensor monitors your Kubernetes and {ocp} clusters. These services currently deploy in a single deployment, which handles interactions with the Kubernetes API and coordinates with Collector.

[discrete]
=== Memory and CPU requirements

The following table lists the minimum memory and storage values required to install and run sensor on secured clusters.

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
| Sensor | CPU | Memory

| *Request*
| 2 cores
| 4 GiB

| *Limit*
| 4 cores
| 8 GiB
|===

[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services-admission-controller_{context}"]
== Admission controller

The Admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate policies you configure.

[discrete]
=== Memory and CPU requirements

By default, the admission control service runs 3 replicas. The following table lists the request and limits for each replica.

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
| Admission controller | CPU | Memory

| *Request*
| 0.05 cores
| 100 MiB

| *Limit*
| 0.5 cores
| 500 MiB
|===

[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services-collector_{context}"]
== Collector

Collector monitors runtime activity on each node in your secured clusters. It connects to Sensor to report this information. The collector pod has three containers. The first container is collector, which actually monitors and reports the runtime activity on the node. The other two are compliance and node-inventory.

[discrete]
=== Collection requirements

To use the `CORE_BPF` collection method, the base kernel must support BTF, and the BTF file must be available to collector.
In general, the kernel version must be later than 5.8 (4.18 for {op-system-base} nodes) and the `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` configuration option must be set.

Collector looks for the BTF file in the standard locations shown in the following list:

.BTF file locations
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
/boot/vmlinux-<kernel-version>
/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/vmlinux-<kernel-version>
/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/build/vmlinux
/usr/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/vmlinux
/usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-<kernel-version>
/usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-<kernel-version>.debug
/usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/vmlinux
----
====

If any of these files exists, it is likely that the kernel has BTF support and `CORE_BPF` is configurable.

[discrete]
=== Memory and CPU requirements

By default, the collector service runs 3 replicas. The following tables list the request and limits for each replica and the total for the collector replicas.

== Scanner V4 (Technology Preview)

Scanner V4 is optional. If Scanner V4 is installed on secured clusters, the following requirements apply.

:FeatureName: Scanner V4
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The requirements in this table are based on the default of 2 replicas.

| Scanner V4 Indexer | CPU | Memory
| *Request*

| 3000 MiB
| *Limit*
| 4 cores
| 6 GiB
|===

Scanner V4 requires Scanner V4 DB to store data. The following table lists the minimum memory and storage values required to install and run Scanner V4 DB. For Scanner V4 DB, a PVC is strongly recommended because it ensures optimal performance. The PVC should be 10 GiB.

| Scanner V4 DB | CPU | Memory
| *Request*
| 0.2 cores
| 3 GiB

| *Limit*
| 2 cores
