[id="default-requirements-central-services_{context}"]
= Central services (self-managed)

[NOTE]
====
If you are using {rh-rhacscs-first}, you do not need to review the requirements for Central services, because they are managed by Red{nbsp}Hat. You only need to look at the requirements for secured cluster services.
====

Central services contain the following components:

* Central
* Scanner

[id="default-requirements-central-services-central_{context}"]
== Central

A containerized service called Central handles API interactions and {product-title-short} web portal access while a containerized service called Central DB (PostgreSQL 13) handles data persistence.

Central DB and Scanner V4 require persistent storage in the cluster where Central is installed.

* You can provide storage with a persistent volume claim (PVC).
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use a hostPath volume for storage only if all your hosts (or a group of hosts) mount a shared file system, such as an NFS share or a storage appliance.
Otherwise, your data is only saved on a single node. Red{nbsp}Hat does not
recommend using a hostPath volume.
====
* Use Solid-State Drives (SSD) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.
* If you use a web proxy or firewall, you must configure bypass rules to allow traffic for the `definitions.stackrox.io` and `collector-modules.stackrox.io` domains and enable {product-title} to trust your web proxy or firewall. Otherwise, updates for vulnerability definitions and kernel support packages will fail.
+
{product-title} requires access to:

** `definitions.stackrox.io` for downloading updated vulnerability definitions. Vulnerability definition updates allow {product-title} to maintain up-to-date vulnerability data when new vulnerabilities are discovered or additional data sources are added.
** `collector-modules.stackrox.io` to download updated kernel support packages. Updated Kernel support packages ensure that {product-title} can monitor the latest operating systems and collect data about the network traffic and processes running inside the containers. Without these updates, {product-title} might fail to monitor containers if you add new nodes in your cluster or if you update your nodes' operating system.

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, you should deploy Central in a cluster with limited administrative access.

[id="default-requirements-central-services-scanner_{context}"]
== Scanner

Beginning with version 4.4, {product-title-short} includes two image vulnerability scanners: the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4. The StackRox Scanner is planned to be removed in a future release, but is required for version 4.4 to perform node and platform scanning. Scanner V4 is the preferred image scanner because it provides additional features over the StackRox Scanner, such as expanded language and operating system support and data from additional vulnerability databases.
