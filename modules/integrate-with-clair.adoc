= Integrating with Clair

Beginning with version 4.4, Clair scanning features are available in the new {product-title-short} scanner, Scanner V4, and do not require a separate integration. The instructions in this section are only required if you are using the Clair V4 scanner.

:FeatureName: Scanner V4

Note the following guidance:

* Starting with {product-title-short} 3.74, Red{nbsp}Hat deprecated the previous CoreOS Clair integration in favor of Clair V4 integration. A separate integration was required to use the Clair V4 Scanner. Beginning with version 4.4, this integration is no longer required if you are using Scanner V4.
* There is no planned support for the link:https://quay.github.io/clair/concepts/authentication.html[JWT-based authentication] option for Clair V4 integration in the next {product-title-short} 4.0 version.
