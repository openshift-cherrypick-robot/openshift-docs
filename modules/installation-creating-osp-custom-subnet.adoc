[id="installation-osp-custom-subnet_{context}"]
= Custom subnets in {rh-openstack} deployments

You can deploy a cluster on an {rh-openstack-first} subnet of your choice. The subnet's GUID is passed as the value of `platform.openstack.machinesSubnet` in the `install-config.yaml` file.

This subnet is used as the cluster's primary subnet; nodes and ports are created on it.

Before you run the {product-title} installer with a custom subnet, verify that:

* The target network and subnet are available.

* DHCP is enabled on the target subnet.

* You can provide credentials to the installer that have permission to create ports on the target network.

* If your network configuration requires a router, it is created in {rh-openstack}. Some configurations rely on routers for floating IP address translation.

* Your network configuration doesn't rely on a provider network. Provider networks are not supported.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the API and Ingress VIPs take .5 and .7 respectively from your network's CIDR block. To override these default values,
set values for `platform.openstack.apiVIP` and `platform.openstack.ingressVIP` that are outside of the DHCP allocation pool.
