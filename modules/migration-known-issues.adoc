This release has the following known issues:

* During migration, the CAM tool preserves the following namespace annotations:

** `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`
+
These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748440[*BZ#1748440*])

* When adding an S3 endpoint to the CAM web console, `https://` is supported only for AWS. For other S3 providers, use `http://`.
* If an AWS bucket is added to the CAM web console and then deleted, its status remains `True` because the MigStorage CR is not updated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1738564[*BZ#1738564*])
* Migration fails if the Migration controller is running on a cluster other than the target cluster. The `EnsureCloudSecretPropagated` phase is skipped with a logged warning. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1757571[*BZ#1757571*])
* Cluster-scoped resources, including Cluster Role Bindings and Security Context Constraints, are not yet handled by the CAM. If your applications require cluster-scoped resources, you must create them manually on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759804[*BZ#1759804*])
* Incorrect source cluster storage class is displayed when creating the migration plan. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1777869[*BZ#1777869*])
* If a cluster in the CAM web console becomes inaccessible, it blocks attempts to close open migration plans. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1758269[*BZ#1758269*])
