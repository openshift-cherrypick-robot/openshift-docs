= Configuring the email plugin on {product-title} platform

You can create a new integration in the {product-title} platform by using the email notifier.

To use an annotation to dynamically determine an email recipient:

. Add an annotation similar to the following example in your deployment YAML file, where email is the `Annotation` key that you specify in your email integration.
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
annotations:
  email: _<email_address>_
----

. Use the annotation key `email` in the *Annotation key for recipient* field when you configure {product-title-short}.

[NOTE]
====
An annotation can be on the deployment or the namespace.
====

If you have configured the deployment or namespace with annotation, the {product-title-short} platform sends the alert to the email specified in the annotation. Otherwise, it sends the alert to the default recipient.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Under the *Notifier Integrations* section, select *Email*.
. Select the *New Integration* icon.
. In the *Integration Name* field, enter a name for your email integration.
. For *Email Server*, enter the address of your email server. The email server address is the fully qualified domain name and the port number. An example is `smtp.example.com:465`.
. Enter a username and password of a service account that is used for authentication.
. Optional: Specify the name of the sender, if it is different from the default value.
. Specify the email address that will receive the notifications in the *Default Recipient* box, or enter an annotation key for *Annotation key for recipient*.
. Optional: Turn on the *Disable TLS certificate validation (insecure)* toggle to send email without TLS. You should not disable TLS unless you are using StartTLS.
+
[NOTE]
====
Use TLS for email notifications. Without TLS, all email is sent unencrypted.
====

. Optional: To use StartTLS, select either *Login* or *Plain* for the *Use STARTTLS (Requires TLS To Be Disabled)* drop-down menu.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
With StartTLS, credentials are passed in plain text to the email server before the session encryption is established.

* StartTLS with the *login* parameter sends authentication credentials in a `*base64*` encoded string.
* StartTLS with the *plain* parameter sends authentication credentials to your mail relay in plain text.
