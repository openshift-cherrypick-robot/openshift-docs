== Bug fixes

This release includes the following bug fixes:

* Before this update, some log entries had unrecognized UTF-8 bytes, which caused Elasticsearch to reject messages and block the entire buffered payload. This update resolves the issue: rejected payloads drop the invalid log entries and resubmit the remaining entries. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1574[LOG-1574])

* Before this update, editing the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) did not apply the value of `totalLimitSize` to the Fluentd `total_limit_size` field, which limits the size of the buffer plugin instance. As a result, Fluentd applied the default values. With this update, the CR applies the value of `totalLimitSize` to the Fluentd `total_limit_size` field. Fluentd uses the value of the `total_limit_size` field or the default value, whichever is less. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1736[LOG-1736])
