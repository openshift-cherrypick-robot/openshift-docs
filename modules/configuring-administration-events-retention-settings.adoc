= Configuring administration events retention settings

By configuring the retention settings, you can determine when the administration events expire.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration ->  System Configuration*. You can configure the following setting for administration events:

* *Administration events retention days*: The number of days to retain your administration events. By specifying the number of days, you can control when these events expire. This is important for managing your administration events and ensuring that you retain the information for the desired duration.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the administration events are retained for 4 days. The retention period for these events is determined by the time of the last occurrence and not by the time of creation. This means that an event expires and is deleted only if the time of the last occurrence exceeds the specified retention period.
