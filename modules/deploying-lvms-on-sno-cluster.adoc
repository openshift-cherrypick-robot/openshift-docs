= Deploying {lvms} on {sno} clusters

You can deploy {lvms} on a {sno} bare-metal or user-provisioned infrastructure cluster and configure it to dynamically provision storage for your workloads.

{lvms} creates a volume group using all the available unused disks and creates a single thin pool with a size of 90% of the volume group.
The remaining 10% of the volume group is left free to enable data recovery by expanding the thin pool when required.
You might need to manually perform such recovery.

You can use persistent volume claims (PVCs) and volume snapshots provisioned by {lvms} to request storage and create volume snapshots.

{lvms} configures a default overprovisioning limit of 10 to take advantage of the thin-provisioning feature.
The total size of the volumes and volume snapshots that can be created on the {sno} clusters is 10 times the size of the thin pool.

You can deploy {lvms} on {sno} clusters using one of the following:

* {rh-rhacm-first}
* {product-title} Web Console

== Requirements

Before you begin deploying {lvms} on {sno} clusters, ensure that the following requirements are met:

* You have installed {rh-rhacm-first} on an {product-title} cluster.
* Every managed {sno} cluster has dedicated disks that are used to provision storage.

Before you deploy {lvms} on {sno} clusters, be aware of the following limitations:

* You can only create a single instance of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) on an {product-title} cluster.
* You can make only a single `deviceClass` entry in the `LVMCluster` CR.
* When a device becomes part of the `LVMCluster` CR, it cannot be removed.
