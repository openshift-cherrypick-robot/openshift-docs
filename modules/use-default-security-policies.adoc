= Using default security policies

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes a set of default policies that provide broad coverage to identify security issues and ensure best practices for security in your environment.

To view the default policies:

* In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.

The *Policies* view lists the default policies and includes the following parameters for each policy:

* *Policy*: A name for the policy.
* *Description*: A longer, more detailed description of the alert for the policy.
* *Status*: The current status of the policy, either *Enabled* or *Disabled*.
* *Notifiers*: The list of notifiers that are configured for the policy.
* *Severity*: A ranking of the policy, either critical, high, medium, or low, for the amount of attention required.
* *Lifecycle*: The phase of the container lifecycle (build, deploy, or runtime) that this policy applies to, and the phase at which enforcement applies, when the policy is enabled.

The default policies have preconfigured parameters and belong to categories such as:

* Anomalous Activity
* Cryptocurrency Mining
* DevOps Best Practices
* Kubernetes
* Network Tools
* Package Management
* Privileges
* Security Best Practices
* System Modification
* Vulnerability Management

You can edit these categories and create your own categories.
