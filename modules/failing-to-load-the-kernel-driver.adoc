= Failing to load the kernel driver

Before Collector starts, it loads the kernel driver. However, in rare cases, you might encounter issues where Collector cannot load the kernel driver, resulting in various error messages or exceptions. In such cases, you must check the logs to identify the problems with failure in loading the kernel driver.

Consider the following Collector log:
