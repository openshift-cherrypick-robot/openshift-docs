= kn plug-ins

The Red Hat distribution of the CLI command `kn` contains extensions of `kn` known as plug-ins. The main use of plug-ins is to extend `kn` by providing additional commands on {ServerlessProductName}, such as for the Kafka stack API. The `kn` plug-ins are used in the same way as the main `kn` functionality.

Currently, Red Hat provides the `kn-source-kafka` plug-in as a Technology Preview feature.
