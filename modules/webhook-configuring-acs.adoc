= Configuring integrations by using webhooks

[role="_abstract"]
Create a new integration in {product-title} by using the webhook URL.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll down to the *Notifier Integrations* section and select *Generic Webhook*.
. Click *New integration*.
. Enter a name for *Integration name*.
. Enter the webhook URL in the *Endpoint* field.
. If your webhook receiver uses an untrusted certificate, enter a CA certificate in the *CA certificate* field. Otherwise, leave it blank.
+
[NOTE]
====
The server certificate used by the webhook receiver must be valid for the endpoint DNS name.
You can click *Skip TLS verification* to ignore this validation.
Red Hat does not suggest turning off TLS verification. Without TLS verification, data could be intercepted by an unintended recipient.
====
. Optional: Click *Enable audit logging* to receive alerts about all the changes made in {product-title}.
//See link:/docs/integrate-with-other-tools/enable-audit-logging/[Audit Logging] for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Red Hat suggests using separate webhooks for alerts and audit logs to handle these messages differently.
====
. To authenticate with the webhook receiver, enter details for one of the following:
** *Username* and *Password* for basic HTTP authentication
** Custom *Header*, for example: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
. Use *Extra fields* to include additional key-value pairs in the JSON object that {product-title} sends.
For example, if your webhook receiver accepts objects from multiple sources, you can add `"source": "rhacs"` as an extra field and filter on this value to identify all alerts from {product-title}.
. Select *Test* to send a test message to verify that the integration with your generic webhook is working.
. Select *Save* to create the configuration.
