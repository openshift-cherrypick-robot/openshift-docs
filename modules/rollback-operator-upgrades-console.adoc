= Rolling back an Operator upgrade by using the web console

You can roll back the Operator version by using the {ocp} web console.

.Prerequisites

- You have access to an {ocp} cluster web console using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Locate the {product-title-short} Operator and click on it.
. On the *Operator Details* page, select *Uninstall Operator* from the *Actions* list. Following this action, the Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
. Determine the previous version you want to roll back to by choosing one of the following options:
* If the current Central instance is running, you can query the {product-title-short} API to get the rollback version by running the following command from a terminal window:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k -s -u <user>:<password> https://<central hostname>/v1/centralhealth/upgradestatus | jq -r .upgradeStatus.forceRollbackTo
----
* You can create a pod and extract the previous version by performing the following steps:
+
[NOTE]
====
This procedure can only be used for {product-title-short} release 3.74 and earlier when the `rocksdb` database is installed.
====
.. Go to *Workloads* -> *Deployments* -> *central*.
.. Under *Deployment details*, click the down arrow next to the pod count to scale down the pod.
.. Go to *Workloads* -> *Pods* -> *Create Pod* and paste the contents of the pod spec as shown in the following example into the editor:
+

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: get-previous-db-version
spec:
  containers:
  - name: get-previous-db-version
    image: registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-main-rhel8:<rollback version>
    command:
    - sh
    args:
    - '-c'
    - "cat /var/lib/stackrox/.previous/migration_version.yaml | grep '^image:' | cut -f 2 -d : | tr -d ' '"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: stackrox-db
      mountPath: /var/lib/stackrox
  volumes:
  - name: stackrox-db
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: stackrox-db
----
.. Click *Create*.
.. After the pod is created, click the *Logs* tab to get the version string.
. Update the rollback configuration by performing the following steps:
.. Go to *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps* -> *central-config* and select *Edit ConfigMap* from the *Actions* list.
.. Find the `forceRollbackVersion` line in the value of the `central-config.yaml` key.
.. Replace `none` with `3.73.3`, and then save the file.
. Update Central to the earlier version by performing the following steps:
.. Go to *Workloads* -> *Deployments* -> *central* and select *Edit Deployment* from the Actions list.
.. Update the image name, and then save the changes.

.Verification

. Ensure that the Central pod starts and has a `ready` status. If the pod crashes, check the logs to see if the backup was restored. A successful log message appears similar to the following example:
+
----
Clone to Migrate ".previous", ""
----
. Reinstall the Operator on the rolled back channel. For example, `3.74.2` is installed on the `rhacs-3.74` channel.
