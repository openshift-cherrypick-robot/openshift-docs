= Creating Logical Volume Manager cluster

You can create a Logical Volume Manager cluster after you install {lvms}.

{product-title} supports additional worker nodes for {sno} clusters on bare-metal user-provisioned infrastructure.
{lvms} detects and uses the additional worker nodes when the new nodes show up.
In case you need to set a node filter for the additional worker nodes, you can use the YAML view while creating the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This node filter matching is not the same as the pod label matching.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed {lvms} from the OperatorHub.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} Web Console, click *Operators â†’ Installed Operators* to view all the installed Operators.
+
Ensure that the *Project* selected is `openshift-storage`.

. Click on *LVM Storage*, and then click *Create LVMCluster* under *LVMCluster*.
. In the *Create LVMCluster* page, select either *Form view* or *YAML view*.
. Enter a name for the cluster.
. Click *Create*.
. Optional: To add a node filter, click *YAML view* and specify the filter in the `nodeSelector` section:
+
[source,yaml]

.Verification Steps

. Click *Storage -> Storage Classes* from the left pane of the {product-title} Web Console.

. Verify that the `lvms-<device-class-name>` storage class is created with the `LVMCluster` creation. By default, `vg1` is the `device-class-name`.
