= roxctl scanner download-db

Download the offline vulnerability database for StackRox Scanner or Scanner V4.

:FeatureName: Scanner V4
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This command downloads version-specific offline vulnerability bundles. The system contacts Central to determine the version if one is not specified. If communication fails, the download defaults to the version embedded within `roxctl`.

By default, it will attempt to download the database for the determined version and less-specific variants. For example, if version `4.4.1-extra` is specified, downloads will be attempted for the following version variants:

* 4.4.1-extra
* 4.4.1
* 4.4

.Usage
