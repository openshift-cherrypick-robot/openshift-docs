=== User-workload ingress traffic on AWS Local Zones

Developers must use an external Load Balancer, such as AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB), to enable internet access to applications on AWS Local Zones. The AWS Load Balancer Operator is available through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

To optimize application deployment on AWS Local Zone locations, provision at least one new ALB Ingress per location to expose services that are deployed on the zones.

If the cluster administrator shares ALB Ingress subnets across different locations, end-user latency can increase when traffic routes to back ends are located in different zones than from where the traffic originated.
