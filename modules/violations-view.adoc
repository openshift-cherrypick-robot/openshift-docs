You can analyze all violations in the *Violations* view and take corrective action.

In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Violations* to see the discovered violations.

The *Violations* view shows a list of violations with the following attributes for each row:

* *Policy*: The name of the violated policy.
* *Entity*: The entity where the violation occurred.
* *Type*: The type of entity, such as a deployment, namespace, or cluster.
* *Enforced*: Indicates if the policy was enforced when the violation occurred.
* *Severity*: Indicates the severity as `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`.
* *Categories*: The policy categories. Policy categories are listed in *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management* in the *Policy categories* tab.

* *Lifecycle*: The lifecycle stages to which the policy applies, `Build`, `Deploy`, or `Runtime`.
* *Time*: The date and time when the violation occurred.

Similar to other views, you can perform the following actions:

* Select a column heading to sort the violations in ascending or descending order.
* Use the filter bar to filter violations.
See the Searching and filtering section for more information.
* Select a violation in the *Violations* view to see more details about the violation.
