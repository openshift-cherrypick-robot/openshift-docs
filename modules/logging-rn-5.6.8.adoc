== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the vector collector terminated unexpectedly when input match label values contained a `/` character within the `ClusterLogForwarder`. This update resolves the issue by quoting the match label, enabling the collector to start and collect logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4091[LOG-4091])

* Before this update, when viewing logs within the {product-title} web console, clicking the *more data available* option loaded more log entries only the first time it was clicked. With this update, more entries are loaded with each click. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OU-187[OU-187])

* Before this update, when viewing logs within the {product-title} web console, clicking the *streaming* option would only display the *streaming logs* message without showing the actual logs. With this update, both the message and the log stream are displayed correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OU-189[OU-189])

* Before this update, the Loki Operator reset errors in a way that made identifying configuration problems difficult to troubleshoot. With this update, errors persist until the configuration error is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4158[LOG-4158])

* Before this update, clusters with more than 8,000 namespaces caused Elasticsearch to reject queries because the list of namespaces was larger than the `http.max_header_size` setting. With this update, the default value for header size has been increased, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4278[LOG-4278])
