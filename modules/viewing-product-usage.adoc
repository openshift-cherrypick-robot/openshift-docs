{product-title-short} provides product usage data for the number of secured Kubernetes nodes and CPU units for secured clusters based on metrics collected from {product-title-short} sensors. This information can be useful to estimate {product-title-short} consumption data for reporting.

For more information on how CPU units are defined in Kubernetes, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu[CPU resource units].

[NOTE]
====
{ocp} provides its own usage reports; this information is intended for use with self-managed Kubernetes systems.
====

{product-title-short} provides the following usage data in the web portal and API:

* Currently secured CPU units: The number of Kubernetes CPU units used by your {product-title-short} secured clusters, as of the latest metrics collection.
* Currently secured node count: The number of Kubernetes nodes secured by {product-title-short}, as of the latest metrics collection.
* Maximum secured CPU units: The maximum number of CPU units used by your {product-title-short} secured clusters, as measured hourly and aggregated for the time period defined by the *Start date* and *End date*.
* Maximum secured node count: The maximum number of Kubernetes nodes secured by {product-title-short}, as measured hourly and aggregated for the time period defined by the *Start date* and *End date*.
* CPU units observation date: The date on which the maximum secured CPU units data was collected.
* Node count observation date: The date on which the maximum secured node count data was collected.

The sensors collect data every 5 minutes, so there can be a short delay in displaying the current data. To view historical data, you must configure the *Start date* and *End date* and download the data file. The date range is inclusive and depends on your time zone.

The presented maximum values are computed based on hourly maximums for the requested period. The hourly maximums are available for download in CSV format.

[NOTE]
====
The data shown is not sent to Red Hat or displayed as Prometheus metrics.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Health*.
. Click *Show product usage*.
. In the *Start date* and *End date* fields, choose the dates for which you want to display data. This range is inclusive and depends on your time zone.
. Optional: To download the detailed data, click *Download CSV*.

You can also obtain this data by using the `ProductUsageService` API object. For more information, go to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.
