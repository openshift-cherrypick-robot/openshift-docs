= About disabling node agent in the DataProtectionApplication
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

If you are not using `Restic`, `Kopia`, or `DataMover` for your backups, you can consider disabling the `nodeAgent` in the `DataProtectionApplication` as shown in the following example. Make sure the {oadp-short} Operator is idle and not running any backups, before you disable the `nodeAgent`.

[source, yaml]
----
# ...
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: false  # <1>
    uploaderType: kopia
# ...
----
<1> Disable node agent.

To enable the `nodeAgent`, set the `enable` flag to `true` as shown in the following example:

[source, yaml]
----
# ...
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: true  # <1>
    uploaderType: kopia
# ...
----
<1> Enable node agent.

You can set up a job to enable and disable the `nodeAgent` in the `DataProtectionApplication`.
