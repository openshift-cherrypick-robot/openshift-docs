= About machine health checks

Machine health checks automatically repair unhealthy machines in a particular machine pool.

To monitor machine health, create a `MachineHealthCheck` custom resource (CR) that includes a label for the set of machines to monitor and a condition to check, such as staying in the `NotReady` status for 15 minutes or displaying a permanent condition in the node-problem-detector. 

The controller that observes a `MachineHealthCheck` CR checks for the condition that you defined. If a machine fails the health check, the machine is automatically deleted and a new one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you see a `machine deleted` event. 

[NOTE]
====
For machines with the master role, the machine health check reports the number of unhealthy nodes, but the machine is not deleted. For example:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinehealthcheck example -n openshift-machine-api
----
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      MAXUNHEALTHY   EXPECTEDMACHINES   CURRENTHEALTHY
example   40%            3                  1
----

To limit the disruptive impact of machine deletions, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, the controller stops deleting machines and you must manually intervene.
====

To stop the check, remove the custom resource.
