= Configuring cluster decommissioning

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {product-title-short} to automatically remove nonactive clusters from {product-title-short}. Nonactive clusters are those that were installed and performed a handshake with Central at least once but have been unreachable by Sensor for a specified period of time. You can also label clusters so that they are not removed when they are unreachable.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Configuration*.
. In the *System Configuration* header, click *Edit*.
. In the *Cluster deletion* section, you can configure the following fields:
* *Decommissioned cluster age*: The number of days that a cluster is unreachable before it is considered for removal from {product-title-short}. If Central cannot reach Sensor on the cluster for this number of days, the cluster and all of its resources are removed from {product-title-short}. To leave this feature disabled, which is the default behavior, enter `0` in this field. To enable this feature, enter a nonzero number, such as `90`, to configure the number of unreachable days. 
* *Ignore clusters which have labels*: To prevent a cluster from being removed, you can configure a label by entering a key and value in this section. Clusters with this label will not be removed, even if they have been unreachable for the number of days set in the *Decommissioned cluster age* field.

** *Key*: Enter the label to use for the cluster.
** *Value*: Enter the value associated with the key. 
+
For example, to preserve production clusters from removal, you can configure a key of `cluster-type` and a value of `production`.

[NOTE]
====
In the *Cluster deletion* section, click *Clusters which have Sensor Status: Unhealthy* to go to the *Clusters* list page. This page is filtered to show nonactive clusters that are subject to removal and a timeframe for the removal from {product-title-short}.

. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
To view and configure this option by using the API, use the `decommissionedClusterRetention` settings in the request payload for the `/v1/config` and `/v1/config/private` endpoints. For more information, see the API documentation for the `ConfigService` object by navigating to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.
