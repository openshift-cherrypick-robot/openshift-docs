= {product-title} architecture overview

{product-title} ({product-title-short}) uses a distributed architecture that supports high-scale deployments and is optimized to minimize the impact on the underlying {ocp} or Kubernetes nodes.

[NOTE]
====
The architecture is slightly different when you install {product-title-short} on Kubernetes and in {ocp}.
However, the underlying components and the interactions between them remain the same.

You install {product-title-short} as a set of containers in your {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster. {product-title-short} includes the following services:

* Central services you install on one cluster
* Secured cluster services you install on each cluster you want to secure by {product-title-short}

In addition to these primary services, {product-title-short} also interacts with other external components to enhance your clusters' security.
