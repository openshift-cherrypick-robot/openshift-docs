= Viewing workload CVEs in Vulnerability Management (2.0)

[role="_abstract"]
You can view a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities, or CVEs, in {product-title-short} across images and deployments. You can use the search filter bar to select specific CVEs, images, deployments, namespaces, or clusters.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Workload CVEs*.
. From the drop-down list, select the search criteria you want to use. You can select an item type, such as a cluster, from the list, and then select the specific name of the item. You can add additional items to the filter by selecting another item from the list and selecting the specific name of the new item. For example, you can select a specific image and a specific cluster to limit results to those selections. You can filter on the following items:
* CVE
* Image
* Deployment
* Namespace
* Cluster
* Component
* Component source
. Optional: Use the *CVE severity* list to select the severities of the CVEs that you want to display.
. Click the relevant button to view a list of vulnerabilities, images, or deployments in the system.

[NOTE]
====
The *Filtered view* icon indicates that the displayed results were filtered based on the criteria that you selected. You can click *Clear filters* to remove all filters, or remove individual filters by clicking on them.
====
. In the list of results, click a CVE, image name, or deployment name to view more information about the item. For example, depending on the item type, you can view the following information:
+
* Whether a CVE is fixable
* Whether an image is active
* The Dockerfile line in the image that contains the CVE
* External links to information about the CVE in Red Hat and other CVE databases

.Search example

The following graphic shows an example of search criteria for a cluster called "production" to view CVEs of critical and important severity in that cluster.
