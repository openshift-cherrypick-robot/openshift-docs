= About RHACS Scanner V4 (Technology Preview)

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title-short} provides its own scanner, or you can configure an integration to use {product-title-short} with another vulnerability scanner.

Beginning with version 4.4, Scanner V4, built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[ClairCore], provides scanning for language and operating system-specific image components. For version 4.4, {product-title-short} also uses the StackRox Scanner to provide some scanning functionality until that functionality is implemented in a future release.
