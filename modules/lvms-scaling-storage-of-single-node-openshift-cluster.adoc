[id="lvms-scaling-storage-of-single-node-openshift-cluster_{context}"]
= Scaling up storage by adding capacity to your {sno} cluster

To scale the storage capacity of your configured worker nodes on a {sno} cluster, you can increase the capacity by adding disks.

.Prerequisites

* You have additional unused disks on each {sno} cluster to be used by {lvms}.

.Procedure

. Log in to {product-title} console of the {sno} cluster.
. From the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page, click on the *LVM Storage Operator* in the `openshift-storage` namespace.
. Click on the *LVMCluster* tab to list the `LVMCluster` CR created on the cluster.
. Select *Edit LVMCluster* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.
. Click on the *YAML* tab.
. Edit the `LVMCluster` CR YAML to add the new device path in the `deviceSelector` section:

[NOTE]
====
In case the `deviceSelector` field is not included during the `LVMCluster` creation, it is not possible to add the `deviceSelector` section to the CR.
You need to remove the `LVMCluster` and then create a new CR.
