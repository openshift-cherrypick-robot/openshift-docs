= Edge machine pools and AWS Local Zones

An edge machine pool is a worker node that runs in AWS Local Zones locations.

* AWS Local Zones resources are more expensive than those of normal availability zones.
* Latency between applications and end users are lower in Local Zones, and it may vary by location. There is a latency impact for some workloads if, for example, routers are mixed between Local Zones and availability zones.
