== Edge machine pools and AWS Local Zones

An edge machine pool generates workers that run in AWS Local Zones locations. These workers differ from the those of the default compute pool in the following ways:

* AWS Local Zones resources are more expensive than those of normal availability zones.
* Latency between applications and end users are lower in Local Zones, and it may vary by location. There is a latency impact for some workloads if, for example, routers are mixed between Local Zones and availability zones.
* Network load balancers do not support Local Zones subnets.
* The time for end users who are close to a metropolitan region to connect to applications that run in Local Zones can be as much as ten times faster than if those applications run in a parent region.
