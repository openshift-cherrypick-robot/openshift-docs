= Edge compute pools and AWS Local Zones

Edge worker nodes are tainted worker nodes that run in AWS Local Zones locations.

* Amazon EC2 instances in the Local Zones are more expensive than Amazon EC2 instances in the Availability Zones
* Latency between applications and end users are lower in Local Zones, and it may vary by location. There is a latency impact for some workloads if, for example, routers are mixed between Local Zones and Availability Zones.
