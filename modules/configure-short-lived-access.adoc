= Configure short-lived access for an OIDC identity token issuer

[role="_abstract"]
Start configuring short-lived access for an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity token issuer.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll to the *Authentication Tokens* category, and then click *Machine access configuration*.
. Click *Create configuration*.
. Select the *configuration type*, choosing one of the following:
** *Generic* if you use an arbitrary OIDC identity token issuer.
** *GitHub Actions* if you plan to access {product-title-short} from GitHub Actions.
. Enter the OIDC identity token issuer.
. Enter the *token lifetime* for tokens issued by the configuration.
+
[NOTE]
====
The format for the *token lifetime* is *XhYmZs* and you cannot set it for longer than 24 hours.
====
. Add rules to the configuration:
** The *Key* is the OIDC token's claim to use.
** The *Value* is the expected OIDC token claim value.
** The *Role* is the role to assign to the token if the OIDC token claim and value exist.
+
[NOTE]
====
Rules are similar to Authentication Provider rules to assign roles based on claim values.

As a general rule, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends to use unique, immutable claims within Rules. The general recommendation is to use the *sub* claim within the OIDC identity token.
For more information about OIDC token claims, see link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims[the list of standard OIDC claims].

. Click *Save*.
